 *      Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List
 *
 * ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Description –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
 *
 *   You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and
 *   previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not
 *   point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one
 *   or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data
 *   structure, as shown in the example
 *   Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level,
 *   doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the
 *   list.
 *

 *   • The number of Nodes will not exceed ‘1000’ .
 *   • ‘1 ≤ Node.val ≤ 10⁵’
