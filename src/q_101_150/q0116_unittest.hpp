  * 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node
  *
  * You are given a “perfect binary tree“ where all
  * leaves are on the same level, and every parent has
  * two children. The binary tree has the following
  * definition:
  * struct Node {
  * int val;
  * Node *left;
  * Node *right;
  * Node *next;
  * }
  * Populate each next pointer to point to its next
  * right node. If there is no next right node, the
  * next pointer should be set to NULL .
  * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL .
  *
  * Constraints:
  * - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2^(12) - 1] .
  * -  -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000 
  *  “Follow-up:“ 
  * - You may only use constant extra space.
  * - The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
  *
